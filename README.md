Module 15 Challenge

USGS data for earthquakes can be visualized using the map included in the logic.js Javascript file. Formatting is in place in both the logic.js file and the style.css file. Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by using size, and the depth of the earthquake is shown using the colors in the legend. Each marker contains a popup that provides additional information about the earthquake represented by it.
